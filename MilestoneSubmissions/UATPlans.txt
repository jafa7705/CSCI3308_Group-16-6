UAT Plans

Feature 1: Functioning User Profile Edit Buttons
    The users want edit buttons on their profiles that are usable/visible by just the person who owns that profile. 
    Test data that could be used are the users individual pages/ID and the bio text.
    This would be tested through the cloud, with verifcication of the changes seen on the page.
    If the buttons are visible to exclusevly the user's owner and the changes that occur are saved to the database and thus
        seen by all users then the feature is working correctly
    User acceptence testers can just be us developers.

Feature 2: Functioning Feed
    The users want a feed that will show posts from other users on the website. They can filter by tags on these posts.
    Test data could be posts that are already on the website (or sample posts). 
    This would be tested through the cloud, with verifcication of the changes seen on the page.
    If posts are visible from other users in the feed section, and the users are able sort with filters then the feature
        is working correctly.
